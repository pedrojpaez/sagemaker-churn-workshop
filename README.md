# sagemaker-churn-workshop
Resources for Sagemaker churn workshop

This lab includes two example notebooks for customer churn modelling using Sagemaker's XGboost implementation.



We will explore a dummy data set from the University of California Irvine Repository of Machine Learning Datasets to illustrate different Sagemaker functionalities such as:

-Built in algorithms \n
-Decoupling computing power (pay per us service) \n
-High level API calls for training and deploying models \n
-Optimized hyperparameter tuning \n
