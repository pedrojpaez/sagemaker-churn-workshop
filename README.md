# sagemaker-churn-workshop
Resources for Sagemaker churn workshop

This lab includes two example notebooks for customer churn modelling using Sagemaker's XGboost implementation.



We will explore a dummy data set from the University of California Irvine Repository of Machine Learning Datasets to illustrate different Sagemaker functionalities such as:

-Built in algorithms
-Decoupling computing power (pay per us service)
-High level API calls for training and deploying models
-Optimized hyperparameter tuning
